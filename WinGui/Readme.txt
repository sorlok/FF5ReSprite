FF5 MultiTool Program

This program can replace the names of characters in FF5.

Installing the program:

0. Install the .NET Runtime, version 8.0:

1. Unzip the zip file and run "FF5 MultiTool.exe"

2. You should see a window with "ACTION NEEDED" near the top in red text. Here's how this works: you will be asked to install a bunch of things; the first of which is "BepInEx". Each time, you will be given a button that does the task for you (e.g., "Install BepInEx"). So click that button, and wait for the program to respond. Sometimes it will ask you to "Launch FF5 and quit at the Title screen". So you'll press the button and then do that. 

2.1 Some of these steps take a LONG time, so be patient. You will only have to go through these steps once. Eventually, the program won't say "ACTION NEEDED", and you'll see all the characters appear with their names, etc.

Using the program:

1. Launch "FF5 MultiTool.exe"

2. You can type new names for each character. Their graphics are shown in case you forget who is who. When you are happy with the names you've chosen, press "Apply Changes". You should see some green text appear saying that you've succeeded. At this point, you can launch FF5 from Steam and your characters will use the new names.

2.1 Note that you must change their names *before* they join your party. So either start a new game or load a save file from the very beginning, before rescuing Lenna at the meteor.

Uninstalling the program:

1. Launch "FF5 MultiTool.exe"

2. Click the "Un-Install" button, and wait a few minutes. Eventually, you will see the "ACTION NEEDED" text again. That means the program has been uninstalled.

3. If you ever get the program into a weird state, you can "manually" uninstall using the following steps:

3.1 Right-click on FF5 in Steam, and choose "Properties...", then click "Installed Files" in the window that opens.

3.2 Click on "Browse..." and Windows will open a File Explorer window showing you various FF5-related files and folders, including "FINAL FANTASY V.exe". 

3.3 Delete ALL of the files shown in that folder. This includes the "FINAL FANTASY V.exe" file, the "FINAL FANTASY V_Data" folder, and others. (Don't worry, your save files are NOT stored here.)

3.4 Back in Steam, right-click on FF5 and choose "Properties...", then "Installed Files" again. Now, click "Verify integrity of game files". Steam will scan the folder you just deleted and re-download all of the necessary FF5 files.
